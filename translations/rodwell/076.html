 <p align="center">MECCA.--31 Verses</p>  
 <p>In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful<br> Doth not a long time pass over MAN, during which he is a thing unremembered?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_191"></A><A HREF="#fn_191"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><br> We have created man from the union of the sexes that we might prove him; and hearing, seeing, have we made him:<br> In a right way have we guided him, be he thankful or ungrateful.<br> For the Infidels we have got ready chains and collars and flaming fire.<br> But a wine cup tempered at the camphor fountain&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_192"></A><A HREF="#fn_192"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> the just shall quaff:<br> Fount whence the servants of God shall drink, and guide by channels from place to place;<br> They who fulfilled their vows, and feared the day whose woes will spread far and wide;<br> Who though longing for it themselves, bestowed their food on the poor and the orphan and the captive:<br> "We feed you for the sake of God: we seek from you neither recompense nor thanks:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_193"></A><A HREF="#fn_193"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A><br> A stern and calamitous day dread we from our Lord."<br> From the evil therefore of that day hath God delivered them and cast on them brightness of face and joy:<br> And hath rewarded their constancy, with Paradise and silken robes:<br> Reclining therein on bridal couches, nought shall they know of sun or piercing cold:<br> Its shades shall be close over them, and low shall its fruits hang down:<br> And vessels of silver and goblets like flagons shall be borne round among them:<br> Flagons of silver whose measure themselves shall mete.<br> And there shall they be given to drink of the cup tempered with zendjebil (ginger)<br> From the fount therein whose name is Selsebil (the softly flowing).<br> Aye-blooming youths go round among them. When thou lookest at them thou wouldest deem them scattered pearls;<br> And when thou seest this, thou wilt see delights and a vast kingdom:<br> Their clothing green silk robes and rich brocade: with silver bracelets shall they be adorned; and drink of a pure beverage shall their Lord give them.<br> This shall be your recompense. Your efforts shall meet with thanks.<br> We ourselves have sent down to thee the Koran as a missive from on high.<br> Await then with patience the judgments of thy Lord, and obey not the wicked among them and the unbelieving:<br> And make mention of the name of thy Lord at morn, at even,<br> And at night. Adore him, and praise him the livelong night.<br> But these men love the fleeting present, and leave behind them the heavy day of doom.<br> Ourselves have we created them, and strengthened their joints; and when we please, with others like unto themselves will we replace them.<br> This truly is a warning: And whoso willeth, taketh the way to his Lord;<br> But will it ye shall not, unless God will it, for God is Knowing, Wise.<br> He causeth whom He will to enter into his mercy. But for the evil doers, He hath made ready an afflictive chastisement.</p>
