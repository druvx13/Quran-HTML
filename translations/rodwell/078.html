 <P><A NAME="fn_97"></A><A HREF="078.html#fr_97">1</A> Of the Resurrection. With regard to the date of this Sura, we can only be guided (I) by the general style of the earlier portion (to verse 37, which is analogous to that of the early Meccan Suras; (2) by verse 17, which pre- supposes lxxvii. 12; (3) by the obviously later style of verse 37 to the end.</P>
 <P><A NAME="fn_98"></A><A HREF="078.html#fr_98">2</A> See Sura ii. 27. This is the title given by the Talmudists to the fifth of the seven heavens.</P>
 <P><A NAME="fn_99"></A><A HREF="078.html#fr_99">3</A> This phrase is of constant recurrence in the Talmud. Maimonides, Yad Hach. i. 3, makes it one of the positive commands of the Rabbins to believe "that there exists a first Being . . . and that all things existing, Heaven and Earth, and whatever is between them, exist only through the truth of his existence."</P>
