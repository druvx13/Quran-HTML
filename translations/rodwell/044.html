Mim.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_194"></A><A HREF="#fn_194"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> By this clear Book!<br> See! on a blessed night&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_195"></A><A HREF="#fn_195"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> have we sent it down, for we would warn mankind:<br> On the night wherein all things are disposed in wisdom,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_196"></A><A HREF="#fn_196"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A><br> By virtue of our behest. Lo! we have ever sent forth Apostles,<br> A mercy from thy Lord: he truly heareth and knoweth all things--<br> Lord of the Heavens and of the Earth and of all that is between them,--if ye be firm in faith--<br> There is no God but He!--He maketh alive and killeth!--Your Lord and the Lord of your sires of old!<br> Yet with doubts do they disport them.<br> But mark them on the day when the Heaven shall give out a palpable SMOKE,<br> Which shall enshroud mankind: this will be an afflictive torment.<br> They will cry, "Our Lord! relieve us from this torment: see! we are believers."<br> But how did warning avail them, when an undoubted apostle had come to them;<br> And they turned their backs on him, and said, "Taught by others, possessed?"<br> Were we to relieve you from the plague even a little, ye would certainly relapse.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_197"></A><A HREF="#fn_197"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A><br> On the day when we shall fiercely put forth our great fierceness, we will surely take vengeance on them!<br> Of old, before their time, had we proved the people of Pharaoh, when a noble apostle presented himself to them.<br> "Send away with me," cried he, "the servants of God; for I am an apostle worthy of all credit:<br> And exalt not yourselves against God, for I come to you with undoubted power;<br> And I take refuge with Him who is my Lord and your Lord, that ye stone me not:<br> And if ye believe me not, at least separate yourselves from me."<br> And he cried to his Lord, "That these are a wicked people."<br> "March forth then, said God, with my servants by night, for ye will be pursued.<br> And leave behind you the cleft sea: they are a drowned host."<br> How many a garden and fountain did they quit!<br> And corn fields and noble dwellings!<br> And pleasures in which they rejoiced them!<br> So was it: and we gave them as a heritage to another people.<br> Nor Heaven nor Earth wept for them, nor was their sentence respited;<br> And we rescued the children of Israel from a degrading affliction--<br> From Pharaoh, for he was haughty, given to excess.<br> And we chose them, in our prescience, above all peoples,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_198"></A><A HREF="#fn_198"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A><br> And we shewed them miracles wherein was their clear trial.<br> Yet these infidels say,<br> "There is but our first death, neither shall we be raised again:<br> Bring back our sires, if ye be men of truth."<br> Are they better than the people of Tobba,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_199"></A><A HREF="#fn_199"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A><br> And those who flourished before them whom we destroyed for their evil deeds?<br> We have not created the Heavens and the Earth and whatever is between them in sport:<br> We have not created them but for a serious end:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_200"></A><A HREF="#fn_200"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> but the greater part of them understand it not.<br> Verily the day of severing&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_201"></A><A HREF="#fn_201"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> shall be the appointed time of all:<br> A day when the master shall not at all be aided by the servant, neither shall they be helped;<br> Save those on whom God shall have mercy: for He is the mighty, the merciful.<br> Verily the tree of Ez-Zakkoum&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_202"></A><A HREF="#fn_202"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A><br> Shall be the sinner's&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_203"></A><A HREF="#fn_203"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A> food:<br> Like dregs of oil shall it boil up in their bellies,<br> Like the boiling of scalding water.<br> "--Seize ye him, and drag him into the mid-fire;<br> Then pour on his head of the tormenting boiling water.<br> --'Taste this:' for thou forsooth art the mighty, the honourable!<br> Lo! this is that of which ye doubted."<br> But the pious shall be in a secure place,<br> Amid gardens and fountains,<br> Clothed in silk and richest robes, facing one another:<br> Thus shall it be: and we will wed them to the virgins with large dark eyes:<br> Therein shall they call, secure, for every kind of fruit;<br> Therein, their first death passed, shall they taste death no more; and He shall keep them from the pains of Hell:--<br> 'Tis the gracious bounty of thy Lord!
