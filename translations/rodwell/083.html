 <p align="center">MECCA.--36 Verses</p>  
 <p>In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful<br> Woe to those who STINT the measure:<br> Who when they take by measure from others, exact the full;<br> But when they mete to them or weigh to them, minish--<br> What! have they no thought that they shall be raised again<br> For the great day?<br> The day when mankind shall stand before the Lord of the worlds.<br> Yes! the register of the wicked is in Sidjin.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_111"></A><A HREF="#fn_111"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><br> And who shall make thee understand what Sidjin is?<br> It is a book distinctly written.<br> Woe, on that day, to those who treated our signs as lies,<br> Who treated the day of judgment as a lie!<br> None treat it as a lie, save the transgressor, the criminal,<br> Who, when our signs are rehearsed to him, saith, "Tales of the Ancients!"<br> Yes; but their own works have got the mastery over their hearts.<br> Yes; they shall be shut out as by a veil from their Lord on that day;<br> Then shall they be burned in Hell-fire:<br> Then shall it be said to them, "This is what ye deemed a lie."<br> Even so. But the register of the righteous is in Illiyoun.<br> And who shall make thee understand what Illiyoun is?<br> A book distinctly written;<br> The angels who draw nigh unto God attest it.<br> Surely, among delights shall the righteous dwell!<br> Seated on bridal couches they will gaze around;<br> Thou shalt mark in their faces the brightness of delight;<br> Choice sealed wine shall be given them to quaff,<br> The seal of musk. For this let those pant who pant for bliss--<br> Mingled therewith shall be the waters of Tasnim--&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_112"></A><A HREF="#fn_112"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><br> Fount whereof they who draw nigh to God shall drink.<br> The sinners indeed laugh the faithful to scorn:<br> And when they pass by them they wink at one another,--<br> And when they return to their own people, they return jesting,<br> And when they see them they say, "These are the erring ones."<br> And yet they have no mission to be their guardians.<br> Therefore, on that day the faithful shall laugh the infidels to scorn,<br> As reclining on bridal couches they behold them.<br> Shall not the infidels be recompensed according to their works?</p>
