 <p><a name="page_1545"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1545</font></A></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">S&#363;ra LXII.</h3>  <h3 align="center" align="center"><i>Jumu&#8216;a</i>, or the Assembly (Friday) Prayer.</h3>  
 <p><i>In the name of God, Most Gracious,<br> Most Merciful</i>.</p>  
 <p>1. Whatever is<br> In the heavens and<br> On earth, doth declare<br> The Praises and Glory<br> Of God,&#8212;the Sovereign,<br> The Holy One, the Exalted<br> In Might, the Wise.</p>  
 <p>2. It is He Who has sent<br> Amongst the Unlettered<br> An apostle from among<br> Themselves, to rehearse<br> To them His Signs,<br> To sanctify them, and<br> To instruct them in Scripture<br> And Wisdom,&#8212;although</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1546"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1546</font></A></p>  
 <p>They had been, before,<br> In manifest error;&#8212;</p>  
 <p>3. As well as (to confer<br> All these benefits upon)<br> Others of them, who<br> Have not already joined them:<br> And He is Exalted<br> In Might, Wise.</p>  
 <p>4. Such is the Bounty of God,<br> Which He bestows<br> On whom He will:<br> And God is the Lord<br> Of the highest bounty.</p>  
 <p>5. The similitude of those<br> Who were charged<br> With the (obligations<br> Of the) Mosaic Law,<br> But who subsequently failed<br> In those (obligations), is<br> That of a donkey<br> Which carries huge tomes<br> (But understands them not).<br> Evil is the similitude<br> Of people who falsify<br> The Signs of God:<br> And God guides not<br> People who do wrong.</p>  
 <p>6. Say: "O ye that<br> Stand on Judaism!</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1547"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1547</font></A></p>  
 <p>If ye think that ye<br> Are friends to God,<br> To the exclusion of<br> (Other) men, then express<br> Your desire for Death,<br> If ye are truthful!"</p>  
 <p>7. But never will they<br> Express their desire<br> (For Death), because of<br> The (deeds) their hands<br> Have sent on before them!<br> And God knows well<br> Those that do wrong!</p>  
 <p>8. Say: "The Death from which<br> Ye flee will truly<br> Overtake you: then will<br> Ye be sent back<br> To the Knower of things<br> Secret and open: and He<br> Will tell you (the truth<br> Of) the things that ye did!"</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 2.</h5>  
 <p>9. O ye who believe!<br> When the call is proclaimed<br> To prayer on Friday<br> (The Day of Assembly),</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1548"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1548</font></A></p>  
 <p>Hasten earnestly to the<br> Remembrance<br> Of God, and leave off<br> Business (and traffic):<br> That is best for you<br> If ye but knew!</p>  
 <p>10. And when the Prayer<br> Is finished, then may ye<br> Disperse through the land,<br> And seek of the Bounty<br> Of God: and celebrate<br> The Praises of God<br> Often (and without stint):<br> That ye may prosper.</p>  
 <p>11. But when they see<br> Some bargain or some<br> Amusement, they disperse<br> Headlong to it, and leave<br> Thee standing. Say:<br> "The (blessing) from the Presence<br> Of God is better than<br> Any amusement or bargain!<br> And God is the Best<br> To provide (for all needs)."</p>
