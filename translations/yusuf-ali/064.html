 <p><i>In the name of God, Most Gracious,<br> Most Merciful.</i></p>  
 <p>1. Whatever is<br> In the heavens and<br> On earth, doth declare<br> The Praises and Glory<br> Of God: to Him belongs<br> Dominion, and to Him belongs<br> Praise: and He has power<br> Over all things.</p>  
 <p>2. It is He Who has<br> Created you; and of you<br> Are some that are<br> Unbelievers, and some<br> That are Believers:<br> And God sees well<br> All that ye do.</p>  
 <p>3. He has created the heavens<br> And the earth<br> In just proportions,<br> And has given you shape,<br> And made your shapes<br> Beautiful: and to Him<br> Is the final Goal.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1556"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1556</font></A></p>  
 <p>4. He knows what is<br> In the heavens<br> And on earth;<br> And He knows what<br> Ye conceal and what<br> Ye reveal: yea, God<br> Knows well the (secrets)<br> Of (all) hearts.</p>  
 <p>5. Has not the story<br> Reached you, of those<br> Who rejected Faith aforetime?<br> So they tasted the evil<br> Result of their conduct;<br> And they had<br> A grievous Penalty.</p>  
 <p>6. That was because there<br> Came to them apostles<br> With Clear Signs,<br> But they said:<br> "Shall (mere) human beings<br> Direct us?" So they rejected<br> (The Message) and turned away.<br> But God can do without (them):<br> And God is<br> Free of all needs,<br> Worthy of all praise.</p>  
 <p>7. The Unbelievers think<br> That they will not be</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1557"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1557</font></A></p>  
 <p>Raised up (for Judgment).<br> Say: "Yea, by my Lord,<br> Ye shall surely be<br> Raised up: then shall ye<br> Be told (the truth) of<br> All that ye did.<br> And that is easy for God."</p>  
 <p>8. Believe, therefore, in God<br> And His Apostle, and<br> In the Light which We<br> Have sent down. And God<br> Is well acquainted<br> With all that ye do.</p>  
 <p>9. The Day that He assembles<br> You (all) for a Day<br> Of Assembly,&#8212;that will be<br> A day of mutual loss<br> And gain (among you).<br> And those who believe<br> In God and work righteousness,&#8212;<br> He will remove from them<br> Their ills, and He will admit<br> Them to gardens beneath which</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1558"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1558</font></A></p>  
 <p>Rivers flow, to dwell therein<br> For ever: that will be<br> The Supreme Achievement.</p>  
 <p>10. But those who reject Faith<br> And treat Our Signs<br> As falsehoods, they will be<br> Companions of the Fire,<br> To dwell therein for aye:<br> And evil is that Goal.</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 2.</h5>  
 <p>11. No kind of calamity<br> Can occur, except<br> By the leave of God:<br> And if any one believes<br> In God, (God) guides his<br> Heart (aright): for God<br> Knows all things.</p>  
 <p>12. So obey God, and obey<br> His Apostle: but if<br> Ye turn back, the duty<br> Of Our Apostle is but<br> To proclaim (the Message)<br> Clearly and openly.</p>  
 <p>13. God! There is no god<br> But He: and on God,<br> Therefore, let the Believers<br> Put their trust.</p>  
 <p>14. O ye who believe!<br> Truly, among your wives</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1559"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1559</font></A></p>  
 <p>And your children are (some<br> That are) enemies to<br> Yourselves: so beware<br> Of them! But if ye<br> Forgive and overlook,<br> And cover up (their faults),<br> Verily God is<br> Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.</p>  
 <p>15. Your riches and your children<br> May be but a trial:<br> But in the Presence of God,<br> Is the highest Reward.</p>  
 <p>16. So fear God<br> As much as ye can;<br> Listen and obey;<br> And spend in charity<br> For the benefit of<br> Your own souls.<br> And those saved from<br> The covetousness of their own</p>  
 <p><a name="page_1560"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1560</font></A></p>  
 <p>Souls,&#8212;they are the ones<br> That achieve prosperity.</p>  
 <p>17. If ye loan to God<br> A beautiful loan, He<br> Will double it to<br> Your (credit), and He<br> Will grant you Forgiveness:<br> For God is most Ready<br> To appreciate (service)<br> Most Forbearing,&#8212;</p>  
 <p>18. Knower of what is hidden<br> And what is open,<br> Exalted in Might,<br> Full of Wisdom.</p>
