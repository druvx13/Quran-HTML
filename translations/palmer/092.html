 <p>[5] But as for him who gives alms and fears God,<br> And believes in the best,<br> We will send him easily to ease!<br> But as for him who is niggardly,<br> And longs for wealth,<br> And calls the good a lie,<br> [10] We will send him easily to difficulty!<br> And his wealth shall not avail him<br> When he falls down (into hell)!<br> Verily, it is for us to guide;<br> And, verily, ours are the hereafter and the former life!<br> And I have warned you of a fire that flames!<br> [15] None shall broil thereon, but the most<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;wretched, who says it is a lie and turns his back.</p>  
 <p>But the pious shall be kept away from it, he who gives his wealth in alms, and who gives no favour to any one for the sake of reward, [20] but only craving the face of his Lord most High; in the end he shall be well pleased!</p>
