 <p>IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.</p>  
 <p>What is in the heavens and what is in the earth celebrates the praises of God, for He is the mighty, the wise!</p>  
 <p>O ye who believe! say not what ye do not. It is most hateful to God that ye say what ye do not.</p>

 <p>Verily, God loves those who fight in His cause in ranks as though they were a compact building&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_397"></A><A HREF="#fn_397"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
 <p>[5] When Moses said to his people, 'O my people! why do ye hurt me, when ye know that I am the apostle of God to you?' and when they swerved, God made their hearts to swerve; for God guides not the people who work abomination!</p>  
 <p>And when Jesus the son of Mary said, 'O children of Israel! verily, I am the apostle of God to you, verifying the law that was before me and giving you glad tidings of an apostle who shall come after me, whose name shall be A&#8216;hmed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_398"></A><A HREF="#fn_398"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>!'--but when he did come to them with manifest signs, they said, 'This is manifest sorcery!'</p>  
 <p>And who is more unjust than he who forges against God a lie when called unto Isl&acirc;m? but God guides not the unjust people.</p>  
 <p>They desire to put out the light of God with their mouths; but God will perfect His light, averse although the misbeliever be!</p>  
 <p>He it is who sent His Apostle with guidance and the religion of truth to set it above all religion; averse although the idolaters may be.</p>  
 <p>[10] O ye who believe! shall I lead you to a merchandise which will save you from grievous woe?</p>  
 <p>To believe in God and His Apostle, and to fight strenuously in God's cause with your property and</p>

 <p>your persons; that is better for you if ye did but know!</p>  
 <p>He will pardon you your sins, and bring you inter gardens beneath which rivers flow, and goodly dwellings in gardens of Eden;--that is the mighty bliss!</p>  
 <p>And other things which ye love,--help from God and victory nigh! so do thou give the glad tidings unto the believers!</p>  
 <p>O ye who believe! be ye the helpers&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_399"></A><A HREF="#fn_399"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> of God! as Jesus son of Mary said to the apostles, 'Who are my helpers for God?' Said the apostles, 'We are God's helpers&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_400"></A><A HREF="#fn_400"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>!'</p>  
 <p>And a party of the children of Israel believed, and a party misbelieved. And we aided those who believed against their enemies, and they were on the morrow superior!</p>

 <P><A NAME="fn_398"></A><A HREF="061.html#fr_398">281:2</A> Ahmed is equivalent in meaning to Mohammed, and means 'Praised,' 'Laudable.' The allusion is to the promise of the Paraclete in John xvi. 7, the Muslims declaring that the word &#0960;&#0945;&#0961;&#0940;&#0954;&#0955;&#0951;&#0964;&#0959;&#0962; has been substituted in the Greek for &#0960;&#0949;&#0961;&#0953;&#0954;&#0955;&#0965;&#0964;&#8057;&#0962;, which would mean the same as A&#8216;hmed.
