 <A NAME="an_098_001">1</A>&nbsp;Those who disbelieve among the People of the Scripture and the idolaters  could not have left off (erring) till the clear proof came unto them, </P>

 <A NAME="an_098_005">5</A>&nbsp;And they are ordered naught else than to serve Allah, keeping religion pure  for Him, as men by nature upright, and to establish worship and to pay the poor-due.  That is true religion. </P>
 <A NAME="an_098_006">6</A>&nbsp;Lo! those who disbelieve, among the People of the Scripture and the  idolaters, will abide in fire of hell. They are the worst of created beings. </P>
