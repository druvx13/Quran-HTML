 <A NAME="an_075_019">19</A>&nbsp;Then lo! upon Us (resteth) the explanation thereof. </P>
 <A NAME="an_075_020">20</A>&nbsp;Nay, but ye do love the fleeting Now </P>
 <A NAME="an_075_021">21</A>&nbsp;And neglect the Hereafter. </P>

 <A NAME="an_075_038">38</A>&nbsp;Then he became a clot; then (Allah) shaped and fashioned </P>
 <A NAME="an_075_039">39</A>&nbsp;And made of him a pair, the male and female. </P>
